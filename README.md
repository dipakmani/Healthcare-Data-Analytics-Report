Hospital Data Analytics


The Hospital ER Visits Dashboard aims to give a detailed view of various metrics related to emergency room operations. By analyzing patient visits, wait times, and satisfaction scores across different demographics, the dashboard provides actionable insights for healthcare professionals.

The key components of the dashboard include:

Patient Visit Trends (by month, gender, and age group)
Wait Times by Department and Time of Day
Patient Satisfaction Scores by race and department
Demographic Analysis (gender, race, age groups)
Visits by Time of Day and Day of the Week
Performance Insights on the busiest times and most common reasons for ER visits
Features
Patient Visit Trends Displays patient visit counts broken down by month and year, with growth rates showing the change since the previous month. Insights into visits by gender and age groups (Adults, Children, Seniors), giving a clear view of the hospitalâ€™s patient demographics.
Wait Time Analysis Average wait time across departments like Neurology, Orthopedics, Cardiology, and General Practice. Wait times are tracked by the time of day and day of the week, revealing the busiest periods for the ER. This helps in staffing and resource allocation decisions to reduce wait times and improve patient flow.
Satisfaction Scores Displays average patient satisfaction scores categorized by race and department. Helps to identify areas where improvements can be made in patient care to increase overall satisfaction.
Demographic Breakdown The dashboard highlights key patient demographics, showing visits based on gender, race, and age group. This is essential for understanding the patient population and tailoring services to meet their needs.
Busiest Time and Day Insights into the busiest day of the week and the busiest time of day for ER visits, with Tuesday at 4:00 PM being identified as the peak time. This information can assist in optimizing scheduling and resource allocation to meet high-demand periods.
Visualizations
The dashboard includes various visual elements to make the data easy to interpret:

Bar charts for patient visits by gender, age group, and race.
Line charts for tracking patient visits over time.
Heatmaps to visualize wait times by time of day and day of the week.
Tables summarizing patient details such as ID, visit time, gender, race, and satisfaction scores.
Technology Stack
Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing performed on raw hospital ER visit data to ensure accuracy in reporting.
Interactive Filters: Users can filter the dashboard by different criteria (gender, department, date) for a more granular view of the data.
Key Insights
Patient Satisfaction: Native American/Alaska Native patients report the highest satisfaction (6.6/7), while Asian patients report the lowest (3.94/7).
Wait Times: Neurology has the highest average wait time (41 minutes), while Gastroenterology has one of the lowest (34 minutes).
Demographics: The majority of visits are from adult patients, with a balanced gender distribution between male and female patients.
Busiest Time: The ER is busiest on Tuesdays at 4:00 PM, which could be a focus for better resource management.
Future Work
Adding more granular patient data such as reasons for ER visits and follow-up care information. Incorporating predictive analytics to forecast peak visit times. Integration with hospital staffing and resource allocation systems for dynamic management.

Conclusion
This project showcases how data visualization can be a powerful tool in healthcare management. By understanding patterns in ER visits, wait times, and patient satisfaction, hospitals can improve their operational efficiency and enhance the quality of care provided to patients.
